/**
 * Example game using in-app billing version 3.
 *
 * Before attempting to run this sample, please read the README file. It
 * contains important information on how to set up this project.
 *
 * All the game-specific logic is implemented here in MainActivity, while the
 * general-purpose boilerplate that can be reused in any app is provided in the
 * classes in the util/ subdirectory. When implementing your own application,
 * you can copy over util/*.java to make use of those utility classes.
 *
 * This game is a simple "driving" game where the player can buy gas
 * and drive. The car has a tank which stores gas. When the player purchases
 * gas, the tank fills up (1/4 tank at a time). When the player drives, the gas
 * in the tank diminishes (also 1/4 tank at a time).
 *
 * The user can also purchase a "premium upgrade" that gives them a red car
 * instead of the standard blue one (exciting!).
 *
 * The user can also purchase a subscription ("infinite gas") that allows them
 * to drive without using up any gas while that subscription is active.
 *
 * It's important to note the consumption mechanics for each item.
 *
 * PREMIUM: the item is purchased and NEVER consumed. So, after the original
 * purchase, the player will always own that item. The application knows to
 * display the red car instead of the blue one because it queries whether
 * the premium "item" is owned or not.
 *
 * INFINITE GAS: this is a subscription, and subscriptions can't be consumed.
 *
 * GAS: when gas is purchased, the "gas" item is then owned. We consume it
 * when we apply that item's effects to our app's world, which to us means
 * filling up 1/4 of the tank. This happens immediately after purchase!
 * It's at this point (and not when the user drives) that the "gas"
 * item is CONSUMED. Consumption should always happen when your game
 * world was safely updated to apply the effect of the purchase. So,
 * in an example scenario:
 *
 * BEFORE:      tank at 1/2
 * ON PURCHASE: tank at 1/2, "gas" item is owned
 * IMMEDIATELY: "gas" is consumed, tank goes to 3/4
 * AFTER:       tank at 3/4, "gas" item NOT owned any more
 *
 * Another important point to notice is that it may so happen that
 * the application crashed (or anything else happened) after the user
 * purchased the "gas" item, but before it was consumed. That's why,
 * on startup, we check if we own the "gas" item, and, if so,
 * we have to apply its effects to our world and consume it. This
 * is also very important!
